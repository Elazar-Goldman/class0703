## onClick 
- change body color to a color
- change buttong BG to a different color
- change buttong color to a different color
- and the title.

## Are you done
- change all colors to different colors when the title id clicked

## Function has 3 parts

- declering the function -> funciton <name>(){}

- Populating the function - place all code

== up to this stage, JS has a funcition but not in use

== this is when the function is in use
- Calling the function


## big challange

- crate a button that onClick fires a function called randColor

<!--First stage-->
- randColor changes the BG color of the btn,
 <!--Second stage -this is the only one to remain  -->

it does so by calling another function that returns a value
