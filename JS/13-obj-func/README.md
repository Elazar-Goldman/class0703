# Exercise in JS functions:

T# he following challenges are for you to further your skills in writing JS functions

- There are a number of methods in writing a function in JS

- A Js function - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions

- An arrow function - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions

# Open a new project:

- Create the following documents:

- index.heml
- css/style.css
- js/app.js
- README.md
- Connect all files

# First challenge:

- build a function that changes the backgroundColor of the <p id="first-p">.

- The function should except one argument and change the color based on the argument. If no argument was passed the function will change the color to “red”

# Second challenge:

- build a function that receives one number argument. And returns the square of that number

# third challenge:

- Build the following:
- input - for user to add a number
- div – display results
- button - to receive results.
- button – to clear both the input and results
- User will add a number in the input. When the user clicks the submit button, the square of the number he inputted will appear inside the result div

- When user clicks the clear button, both the input and result div will be cleared.

# Fourth challenge:

- Build the following:
- 3 inputs for the user to add numbers
- A div to display results
- Button - to receive results.
- Button – to clear both the input and results

- please build on object that has the triangel calculations

- first calculation sqr. 

- second funciton will add a sum

- third return true of false

- Build a function to check if the 3 numbers entered will return a right-angle triangle.

- A right-angle triangle follows the pythagorean rule : a^+b^=c^

- Use the function you have already built when building your new function. Display the result of the function in the result div.
  When clicking the clear button, clear all three inputs and the result div.

- Use the function you have already built to clear the fields.

# Fifth challenge:

- Build the following:
- A new HTML document
- A new JS document
- A new CSS document
- And connect

- Build one button
- Build four divs
- div-1 = even-big
- div-2 = even-small
- div-3 = odd- prime
- div-4 = odd-nonPrime

- When the button is clicked, fire a function that generates a random number between 0-30
  If the number is even, check if it is big or small (bid >15). Display big even numbers in the first div.
  Display small even number in the second div
  If the number is odd check if it prime or not (check if number divides into 3,5,7).

- Prime numbers are displayed in div 3. And non-prime number in div 4

# Fifth challenge – second part:

- Build an array containing 6 colors.
- Build a function, or add into a function the ability to choose a single color from the array, based on the random number generated.
  Color the backgroundColor of the corresponding div with the selected color.

# Fifth challenge – third part:

- Let the backgroundColor of the div from the previous challenge be colored for 1.5 seconds and return to the original state.
